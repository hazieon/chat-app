# WebSockets Workshop

A websockets chat app project. Built the basic functionalities of an instant messaging service.
We built this application as part of the School of Code bootcamp to get hands on with web sockets for the first time.
We followed a 'get started' tutorial and modified the JQUERY section into vanilla JavaScript. (https://socket.io/get-started/chat/)

# Pair programming
Remotely creating code projects in pairs has some challenges, but we used VSCode's LiveShare feature to code on the same code base concurrently.
To share our localhost apps for testing during development, we used ngrok. (https://ngrok.com/)
