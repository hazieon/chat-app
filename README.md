# WebSockets Workshop

## VSCode LiveShare

- Install the LiveShare extension for VSCode.
- Practice working on the same computer using LiveShare for this workshop, but still take turns as the driver and navigator!

## My first chat app 

- Go to https://socket.io/get-started/chat/ and follow the instructions to set up your very first chat application with socket.io.
- Be careful on the 'Emitting events' section: the tutorial uses jquery. WE DO NOT USE JQUERY. Refactor the code in the instructions in vanilla JavaScript. HINT: think through what you want to happen and make a plan. If it helps, substitue the WebSocket part of the code for console logs until you have the basic functionality working.

## Sharing our apps

- Usually we would have to deploy our code to use it online with one another. This would mean separating our chat app into a frontend and a backend. However, there is a way we can share our localhost apps for testing during development.
- Go to https://ngrok.com/ and download ngrok on your computer.
- Follow the ngrok documentation to share your localhost chat apps with each other.

## Bonus tasks

- There is a list of bonus tasks at the bottom of the getting started guide on socket.io.
- Choose features and add them to your app.

## EXTRA BONUS 

- Refactor your chat app in React and separate it into a backend and frontend to deploy.
